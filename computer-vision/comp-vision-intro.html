			<h1>Computer Vision with Python and OpenCV</h1>
			<p>A graduate student was attempting to identify size differences in tissue between her experimental and control conditions. 
			She and her assistants were using a grid counting method to measure the tissue, but were not getting consistent counts. This
			appeared to be a problem that could be solved using computer vision.</p>
			<p>The first program, RGB to HSV, takes the Red, Green and Blue values found using <a href="https://www.getpaint.net/">"Paint.Net"</a>
			and converts it to the Hue, Saturation and Value used by OpenCV in the Stain Selection program.
