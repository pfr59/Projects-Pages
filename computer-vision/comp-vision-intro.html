			<h1>Computer Vision with Python and OpenCV</h1>
			
			<p>A graduate student was attempting to identify size differences in tissue between her experimental and control conditions. 
			She and her assistants were using a grid counting method to measure the tissue, but were not getting consistent counts. This
			was a problem made for computer vision.</p>
			
			<p>First the structures of interest in the tissue had to be identified by the color of their respective stain. The RGB to HSV  
			program takes the Red, Green and Blue values found using <a href="https://www.getpaint.net/">"Paint.Net"</a> when hovering 
			over the tissue of interest and converts it to the Hue, Saturation and Value used by OpenCV in the Stain Selection program.
			</p>
			
			<p>The Hue, Saturation and Value is then entered into the Stain Selection program, which then identifies and measures the 
			tissue of interest in a given set of tissue image. The results were consistent, the graduate student was able to move 
			forward with her analysis.</p>
			
			<p>The programs could be used as is to analyze differences between digital images.</p>
			
			<p>Both programs were created using lessons learned from Patrick W. Crawford's LinkedIn Learning class: 
			"OpenCV for Python Developers" and countless Google searches.</p>
