			<h1><u>Objective</u></h1>
			<p>This is my opportunity to give back to the community of 
			developers here on GitHub, Stack Overflow and countless other
			Internet resources I have used while developing projects of my
			own.</p>
			
			<p>Some were developed to meet specific needs. Others spawned 
			as acts of whimsy. In either case I hope you find them helpful.</p>
