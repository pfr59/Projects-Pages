			<h1>Change Blindness with Java</h1>
			
			<p>A faculty member had been using this website <a href="http://gocognitive.net/demo/change-blindness">http://gocognitive.net/demo/change-blindness</a>, 
			developed by <a href="https://www.uidaho.edu/class/psychcomm/graduate/faculty/steffen-werner">Dr. Steffen Werner</a> of the University of Idaho, to 
			demonstrate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_blindness">change blindness</a>. Unfortunately the website used 
			<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash">Adobe Flash</a> which was discontinued in most of the world in 2020.</p>
			
			<p>Prior to the site going down, its function was analyzed and some of the images it used captured. This Java program is an attempt to replicate its
			function.</p>
